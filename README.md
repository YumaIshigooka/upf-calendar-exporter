# upf-calendar-exporter

exports UPF University calendar to google calendar

this works for any student of UPF which accesses its calendar using https://campusglobal.upf.edu/

this is not a project endorsed by UPF; changes in their UPF's end might break the current solution

report bugs through comments if possible - be nice, it is a one day built :)

if someone has time, it would be nice to branch and integrate with google calendar api + automate sign in/ajax cookies/token ([I have no clue if this is possible]) + .py that can be scheduled with TaskScheduler to get new updates
