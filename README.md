# upf-calendar-exporter

exports UPF University calendar to Google Calendar (and similar services)

this works for any student of UPF which accesses its calendar using https://campusglobal.upf.edu/

***
HOW TO EXECUTE

- for Windows, use the .exe executables in ./builds

- for other devices (including Windows as well), Git clone the project and execute main.py; if having problems when executing in Apple devices, refer to https://github.com/miquelvir/upf-calendar-exporter/issues/1
***

this is not a project endorsed by UPF; changes in UPF's end might break the current solution


report bugs through comments if possible - be nice, it is a one day built :)


***

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS


if someone has time and knowledge, it would be nice to branch and integrate with google calendar api + automate sign in/ajax cookies/token ([I have no clue if this is possible]) + .py that can be scheduled with TaskScheduler to get new updates
